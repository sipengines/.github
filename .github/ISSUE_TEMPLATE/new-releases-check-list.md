###### Release process:

**Note:** if you are releasing both mobile and web you should only release web once the mobile version is **marked as complete** on shipit. The mobile release [updates the version](https://github.com/Shopify/inbox-client/blob/main/android/app/support/version), which will save you some work in the web release.

## Cut the release - Thursday Afternoon

## Test the release candidate - Friday Morning (with next ATC)

When testing the release candidate, it is important to test new features from the [RELEASE NOTES](https://github.com/Shopify/inbox-client/wiki/Release-notes) as well as critical paths from the [tophat checklist](https://github.com/Shopify/inbox-client/blob/main/docs/TOPHAT_CHECKLIST.md) to ensure that the app is functioning properly.

**iOS**

1. Install `Shopify Inbox` from the App Store and log in to the app.
2. Install the `Testflight` build for the new release over the one from the App Store and ensure that the app does not crash on launch. This is testing regressions.
3. Test the app as indicated at the top of this section.

**Android**

1. Visit [shipit-mobile releases](https://shipit-mobile.shopifycloud.com/projects/73) to find the last release. Install the last version's APK onto your android device and log in to the app.
2. Go to the new release and download that APK and then install the new release's APK over the last one and ensure that the app does not crash on launch. This is testing regressions.
3. Test the app as indicated at the top of this section.

**Web**

1. Pull the branch for either the `Android` or the `iOS` release.
2. Build Inbox Web locally from this branch: `dev s`.
